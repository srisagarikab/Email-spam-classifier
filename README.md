Email Spam Detection:
This project uses machine learning to classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam). It preprocesses email text using TF-IDF vectorization and applies classifiers like Naive Bayes for prediction. The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. You can run the project by installing dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt, preprocessing the data, and training the model.

Technologies: Python, scikit-learn, NLTK, Pandas, NumPy.
